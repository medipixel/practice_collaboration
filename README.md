# practice_collaboration
Practice collaboration with a simple calculator example.
The participants will work on implementing 4 functionalities: add, sub, mul, and div. Each functionality is responsible for a team consisting of two people: one for tests, another for implementation.

## Setting
First, create conda environment
```
conda create -n practice python=3.6.9
conda activate practice
```

Second, install requirements. We set Makefile for convenience, so just type,
```
make dev
```
